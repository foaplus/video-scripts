Here's for the future of... The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The square holes around round pegs. The ones who say things differently. They're not fond of rules. They have no respect for status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is... ignore them. Because they will change things. They push the muggle race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genuine. Because the muggles who are crazy enough to think they can change the future, are the ones who will... obviously.
